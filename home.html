 <p class = "norm">Welcome to DataDump! Here we have the information of numerous data structures, such as ArrayLists, Hashmaps, Binary Search Trees, and much more! Each data structure has basic information, how to iterate through them, and visual representations. Our goal is to help you learn complex data structures quickly and efficiently! Basic understanding of loops, objects, and if-else statemetns are required to understand the website. All programs are demonstrated through Java. 
</p>
 <p class = "norm">if you have no clue what a data structure is, just look at the text below.</p>
   <center><p class = "round2">What are Data Structures?</p></center>
   <p class = "norm">Data structures are the most important thing that you will find in the world of Computer Science, no matter your field. They hold all sorts of data, from primitive ints, strings, booleans, and chars, to user made objects. Although this sounds simples, there are numerous data structures in the world of CS, each unique but all interrelated. This website will teach you about some of these data structures. To start off, check out<a href="1DArrays.html">'single array'</a> and then work your way from there.
</p>
   <center><p class = "round2">How this website works</p></center>
   <p class = "norm">This page will give you an idea of how each data structure in this website is explained. Each Data Structure has itâ€™s own page, and each page has 3 sections. Before any of the sections, there is a short introduction that gives a brief explanation of how that Data Structure holds data. The first section,'Initialization', gives examples on how to instantiate that Data Structure and explains each separate part of the Initialization. The section after this, 'Useful methods', is a list of the most helpful methods of that Data Structure, along with a link to the API of that Data Structure, which contains all the methods for that Class. The last section, 'iteration', gives  a short portion of code that shows you how to iterate through that Data Structure. However, in some cases, this code shows you a method of the class of that Data Structure. The method iterates through the Data Structure. In summary, the iteration section gives you a better idea of the inner workings of the Data Structure. There will also be some words in red and green that describe code, like <a class = "red">this</a> and <a class = "green">this</a>. If the word is green, then you can scroll your cursor over the red word and a the part of the code that it is describing will also be highlighted in red as long as your cursor is over the original red word. If the word is green, then you can press the word and the code that it is describing will be highlighted in red. If you click the word again, then the word will unhighlight.
